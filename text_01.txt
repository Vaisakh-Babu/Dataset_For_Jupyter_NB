Algorithm 1: Classical Genetic Algorithm (GA)

Input:
	Population Size, n
	Maximum number of iterations, MAX
Output:
	Global best solution, Y

begin
	Generate initial population of n chromosomes Y, (i=1,2,....)
	Set iteration counter t = 0
	Compute the fitness value of each chromosomes
	while (t<MAX)
		Select a pair of chromosomes from initial population based on fitness
		Apply crossover operation on selected pair with crossover probability
		Apply mutation on the offspring with mutation probability
		Replace old population with newly generated population
		Increment the current iteration t by 1.
	end while
	return the best solution, Y
end
